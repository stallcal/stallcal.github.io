    <p>
      Hello, my name is Caleb. 
      I am on my 3rd year of a B.S. in Chemistry at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
      You can find me on LinkedIn by following the button above. 
      You can find me on discord @deagaroni and on github @stallcal
    </p>
    <!-- caleb, make buttons to link to discord/github/orcid?
maybe once wriedt lab site is back up link there as well.-->
    <p>
      I have worked and played around computers for most of my life and have started
      several project but given them up pretty quickly afterwards.
      My current goal is to learn just enough to accomplish a few personal projects
      and to be able to communicate with other developers about ideas in the future.
      I am currently working with HTML and CSS, but have a few Python projects
      that haven't left the drawing table.
